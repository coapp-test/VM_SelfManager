This project is intended to facilitate the self-management of VMs in a Hyper-V system.

Specifically, when functioning properly, this should allow anyone operating a VM on the host system to perform all of the following operations directly from inside the VM *without having direct access to the VM host computer*:

- Save a new snapshot (with optional name).
- Restore to a specific shapshot (latest or named).
- List snapshots of the current VM.
- Delete a specific snapshot for this VM (By name ONLY).
- Write to a named log file on the host (if enabled by the host).
- Read the contents of a log file on the host (if enabled by the host).
- Start another existing VM on the host (if enabled on the host).
